# mobsf_streamlit
This repo has an implementation with UI from Streamlit, created using MobSf REST API. Run this project by running run_all_apps.py

Create a folder called reports inside the same folder where these Python files are present, or else you will get an error saying the reports folder does not exist.

And also in "flask_app.py" and "streamlit_app.py" I have marked "ADD YOUR LOCAL IP ADDR" change it to your machine's local IP ADDR so that it will work.
